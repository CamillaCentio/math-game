1. When the game starts, children can select the type of math operation they want to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
2. Once they have chosen the operation, the game presents a number for them to solve
3. The children must then enter the correct number in the yellow box and press Submit. 
4. For each correct answer, the child receives points. 
5. If the child answers incorrectly, the game provides feedback and the correct answer so they can learn from their mistake.
